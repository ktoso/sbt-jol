# sbt-jol

Trivial way to inspect OpenJDK's [*Java Object Layout*](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jol/) of your Scala classes.

Get the latest via:

 ```
 // project/plugins.sbt
 addSbtPlugin("pl.project13.sbt" % "sbt-jol" % "0.1.4")
 ```
 
 Which allows you to (note auto-completion works nicely):
 
 ```

  Currently uses jol `0.5`.

-----------
Please note that this plugin is mostly developed on a "on demand" basis by and for myself, contributions are very (!) welcome 
since I most likely will not focus much on it unless I need more features (and for now estimates and internal are all I needed).
